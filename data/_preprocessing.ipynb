What business performance metrics is the new ML system supposed to influence, e.g., the amount of ads revenue, the number of monthly active users? The longer you‚Äôve adopted ML, the more efficient your pipeline will run, the faster your development cycle will be, the less engineering time you‚Äôll need, and the lower your cloud bills will be, which all lead to higher returns. RequirementsReliability: With traditional software systems, you often get a warning, such as a system crash or runtime error or 404. However, ML systems can fail silently. Scalability: An ML system might grow in ML model count. Autoscaling is an indispensable feature in many cloud services: automatically scaling up and down the number of machines depending on usage. Maintainability: Code should be documented. Code, data, and artifacts should be versioned. Models should be sufficiently reproducible so that even when the original authors are not around, other contributors can have sufficient contexts to build on their work. Adaptability: ML systems need to be able to evolve quickly. Iterative Process: Once a system is put into production, it‚Äôll need to be continually monitored and updated. The process looks more like a cycle with a lot of back and forth between different steps. An ML problem is defined by inputs, outputs, and the objective function that guides the learning process. Classification models classify inputs into different categories. Regression models output a continuous value. A regression model can easily be framed as a classification model and vice versa.', metadata={'source': './__original-data/üìöBOOK NOTE : Huyen_2022_Designing Machine Learning Systems: an iterative\\xa0‚Ä¶.pdf', 'page': 0})"
