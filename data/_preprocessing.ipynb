The document model targets use cases where data comes in self-contained documents and relationships between one document and another are rare. The graph model goes in the opposite direction, targeting use cases where relationships between data items are common and important. Compared to the relational model, it\\u2019s harder and less efficient to execute joins across documents compared to across tables.Structured Versus Unstructured Data Structured data follows a predefined data model, also known as a data schema. The disadvantage of structured data is that you have to commit your data to a predefined schema. If your schema changes, you\\u2019ll have to retrospectively update all your data, often causing mysterious bugs in the process. Unstructured data doesn\\u2019t adhere to a predefined data schema. It\\u2019s usually text but can also be numbers, dates, images, audio, etc. Unstructured data also allows for more flexible storage options. A repository for storing structured data is called a data warehouse.Data warehouses are used to store data that has been processed into formats ready to be used. A repository for storing unstructured data is called a data lake. Data lakes are usually used to store raw data before processing. Data Storage Engines and Processing Data formats and data models specify the interface for how users can store and retrieve data. Storage engines, also known as databases, are the implementation of how data is stored and retrieved on machines. Transactional and Analytical Processing The transactions are inserted as they are generated, and occasionally updated when something changes, or deleted when they are no longer needed (= online transaction processing (OLTP).Transactional databases are designed to process online transactions and satisfy the low latency, high availability requirements. Analytical questions require aggregating data in columns across multiple rows of data. Analytical databases are designed for this purpose (= online analytical processing (OLAP).ETL: Extract, Transform, and Load When data is extracted from different sources, it\\u2019s first transformed into the desired format before being loaded into the target destination such as a database or a data warehouse. In the extracting phase, you need to validate your data and reject the data that doesn\\u2019t meet your requirements. Transform is, where most of the data processing is done. You might want to join data from multiple sources and clean it. You might want to standardize the value ranges.Load is deciding how and how often to load your transformed data into the target destination, which can be a file, a database, or a data warehouse. Finding it difficult to keep data structured, some companies had this idea: \\u201cWhy not just store all data in a data lake so we don\\u2019t have to deal with schema changes? This process of loading data into storage first and then processing it later is sometimes called ELT (extract, load, transform).\\u25cf\\u25cf\\u25cb\\u25cb\\u25cb\\u25cb\\u25cf\\u25cb\\u25cb\\u25cbBUT: It\\u2019s inefficient to search through a massive amount of raw data for the data that you want. BUT 2: As companies switch to running applications on the cloud and infrastructures become standardized, data structures also become standardized. Modes of Dataflow How do we pass data between different processes that don\\u2019t share memory? When data is passed from one process to another, we say that the data flows from one process to another, which gives us a dataflow. Data passing through databases Data passing through services using requests such as the requests provided by REST and RPC APIs (e.g., POST/GET requests)Because processes communicate through requests, we say that this is request-driven.The most popular styles of requests used for passing data through networks are REST (representational state transfer) and RPC (remote procedure call) Implementations of a REST architecture are said to be RESTful.REST doesn\\u2019t exactly mean HTTP because HTTP is just an implementation of REST. Data passing through a real-time transport like Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis each service can write data to a database and other services that need the data can read from that database. A piece of data broadcast to a real-time transport is called an event. This architecture is, therefore, also called event-driven. pubsub (publish-subscribe) model = any service can publish to different topics in a real-time transport, and any service that subscribes to a topic can read all the events in that topic. The services that produce data don\\u2019t care about what services consume their data. Batch Processing Versus Stream Processing Once your data arrives in data storage engines like databases, data lakes, or data warehouses, it becomes historical data. Historical data is often processed in batch jobs\\u2014jobs that are kicked off periodically.\\u2013When data is processed in batch jobs, we refer to it as batch processing. When you have data in real-time transports like Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis, we say that you have streaming data. Stream processing refers to doing computation on streaming data. Stream processing, when done right, can give low latency because you can process data as soon as data is generated, without having to first write it into databases. Batch features\\u2014features extracted through batch processing\\u2014are also known as static features.

this process of loading data into storage first and then processing it later is sometimes called elt (extract, load, transform).**********but: it's inefficient to search through a massive amount of raw data for the data that you want. but 2: as companies switch to running applications on the cloud and infrastructures become standardized, data structures also become standardized. modes of dataflow how do we pass data between different processes that don't share memory? when data is passed from one process to another, we say that the data flows from one process to another, which gives us a dataflow. data passing through databases data passing through services using requests such as the requests provided by rest and rpc apis (e.g., post/get requests)because processes communicate through requests, we say that this is request-driven.the most popular styles of requests used for passing data through networks are rest (representational state transfer) and rpc (remote procedure call) implementations of a rest architecture are said to be restful.rest doesn't exactly mean http because http is just an implementation of rest. data passing through a real-time transport like apache kafka and amazon kinesis each service can write data to a database and other services that need the data can read from that database. a piece of data broadcast to a real-time transport is called an event. this architecture is, therefore, also called event-driven. pubsub (publish-subscribe) model = any service can publish to different topics in a real-time transport, and any service that subscribes to a topic can read all the events in that topic. the services that produce data don't care about what services consume their data. batch processing versus stream processing once your data arrives in data storage engines like databases, data lakes, or data warehouses, it becomes historical data. historical data is often processed in batch jobs--jobs that are kicked off periodically.-when data is processed in batch jobs, we refer to it as batch processing. when you have data in real-time transports like apache kafka and amazon kinesis, we say that you have streaming data. stream processing refers to doing computation on streaming data. stream processing, when done right, can give low latency because you can process data as soon as data is generated, without having to first write it into databases. batch features--features extracted through batch processing--are also known as static features. streaming features-- features extracted through stream processing--are also known as dynamic features. chapter 4: training datadata is full of potential biases.\"\n",

Beispiel: Convenience sampling Samples of data are selected based on their availability. This sampling method is popular because, well, it\\u2019s convenient. The samples selected by nonprobability criteria are not representative of the real-world data and therefore are riddled with selection biases. Language models are often trained not with data that is representative of all possible texts but with data that can be easily collected\\u2014Wikipedia, Common Crawl, Reddit. Simple Random SamplingIn the simplest form of random sampling, you give all samples in the population equal probabilities of being selected. For example, you randomly select 10% of the population, giving all members of this population an equal 10% chance of being selected. Stratified Sampling To avoid the drawback of simple random sampling, you can first divide your population into the groups that you care about and sample from each group separately. Weighted Sampling Each sample is given a weight, which determines the probability of it being selected. This method allows you to leverage domain expertise. Reservoir Sampling One solution for this problem is reservoir sampling. The algorithm involves a reservoir, which can be an array.Importance Sampling It allows us to sample from a distribution when we only have access to another distribution. Labeling The performance of an ML model still depends heavily on the quality and quantity of the labeled data it\\u2019s trained on. Hand Labels Hand-labeling data can be expensive, especially if subject matter expertise is required. Hand labeling poses a threat to data privacy Hand labeling is slow Slow labeling leads to slow iteration speed and makes your model less adaptive to changing environments and requirements. If the task changes or data changes, you\\u2019ll have to wait for your data to be relabeled before updating your model.Label multiplicity To obtain enough labeled data, companies have to use data from multiple sources and rely on multiple annotators who have different levels of expertise. These different data sources and annotators also have different levels of accuracy. Data lineage It\\u2019s good practice to keep track of the origin of each of your data samples as well as its labels, a technique known as data lineage. Data lineage helps you both flag potential biases in your data and debug your models. Natural Labels Tasks with natural labels are tasks where the model\\u2019s predictions can be automatically evaluated or partially evaluated by the system. Semi-supervision A classic semi-supervision method is self-training. You start by training a model on your existing set of labeled data and use this model to make predictions for unlabeled samples. Assuming that predictions with high raw probability scores are correct, you add the labels predicted with high probability to your training set and train a new model on this expanded training set. This goes on until you\\u2019re happy with your model performance. Semi-supervision is the most useful when the number of training labels is limited. Transfer learning Transfer learning refers to the family of methods where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. Transfer learning is especially appealing for tasks that don\\u2019t have a lot of labeled data. Active learning Active learning is a method for improving the efficiency of data labels. Instead of randomly labeling data samples, you label the samples that are most help- ful to your models according to some metrics or heuristics.Class Imbalance Class imbalance typically refers to a problem in classification tasks where there is a substantial difference in the number of samples in each class of the training data. ML, especially deep learning, works well in situations when the data distribution is more balanced, and usually not so well when the classes are heavily imbalanced Precision, Recall, and F1 true positive rate (also known as recall) false positive rate (also known as the probability of false alarm) We can plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different thresholds. This plot is known as the ROC curve (receiver operating characteristics) \\u2014> When your model is perfect, the recall is 1.0, and the curve is just a line at the top The area under the curve (AUC) measures the area under the ROC curve. Since the closer to the perfect line the better, the larger this area the better Data-level methods: Resampling Data-level methods modify the distribution of the training data to reduce the level of imbalance to make it easier for the model to learn. A common family of techniques is resampling. Resampling includes oversampling, adding more instances from the minority classes, and undersampling, removing instances of the majority classes. When you resample your training data, never evaluate your model on resampled data, since it will cause your model to overfit to that resampled distribution. Undersampling runs the risk of losing important data from removing data. Data Augmentation Data augmentation is a family of techniques that are used to increase the amount of training data.In computer vision, the simplest data augmentation technique is to randomly modify an image while preserving its label. In NLP, you can randomly replace a word with a similar word, assuming that this replacement wouldn\\u2019t change the meaning or the sentiment of the sentence.Perturbation (St\\u00f6rung)Perturbation is also a label-preserving operation Using deceptive data to trick a neural network into making wrong predictions is called adversarial attacks. Adding noise to samples is a common technique to create adversarial samples. Data Synthesis Since collecting data is expensive and slow, with many potential privacy concerns, it\\u2019d be a dream if we could sidestep it altogether and train our models with synthesized data.

Data LeakageData leakage refers to the phenomenon when a form of the label \\u201cleaks\\u201d into the set of features used for making predictions, and this same information is not available during inference. It\\u2019s dangerous because it can cause your models to fail in an unexpected and spectacular way Splitting time-correlated data randomly instead of by time In many cases, data is time-correlated, which means that the time the data is generated affects its label distribution. To prevent future information from leaking into the training process and allowing models to cheat during evaluation, split your data by time, instead of splitting randomly, whenever possible. For example, if you have data from five weeks, use the first four weeks for the train split, then randomly split week 5 into validation and test.Scaling before splitting One common mistake is to use the entire training data to generate global statistics before splitting it into different splits, leaking the mean and variance of the test samples into the training process, and allowing a model to adjust its predictions for the test samples. To avoid this type of leakage, always split your data first before scaling, then use the statistics from the train split to scale all the splits. Filling in missing data with statistics from the test split Leakage might occur if the mean or median is calculated using the entire data instead of just the train split. It can be prevented by using only statistics from the train split to fill in missing values in all the splits. Poor handling of data duplication before splitting If you have duplicates or near-duplicates in your data, failing to remove them before splitting your data might cause the same samples to appear in both train and validation/test splits. Data duplication can result from data collection or merging of different data sources.To avoid this, always check for duplicates before splitting and also after splitting just to make sure. If you oversample your data, do it after splitting. Group leakage A group of examples have strongly correlated labels but are divided into different splits. his type of leakage is common for objective detection tasks that contain photos of the same object taken milliseconds apart\\u2014some of them landed in the train split while others landed in the test split. It\\u2019s hard avoiding this type of data leakage without understanding how your data was generated. Leakage from data generation process Detecting this type of data leakage requires a deep understanding of the way data is collected. There\\u2019s no foolproof way to avoid this type of leakage, but you can mitigate the risk by keeping track of the sources of your data and understanding how it is collected and processed. Normalize your data so that data from different sources can have the same means and variances. Detecting Data Leakage Measure the predictive power of each feature or a set of features with respect to the target variable (label). If a feature has an unusually high correlation, investigate how this feature is generated and whether the correlation makes sense. Do ablation studies to measure how important a feature or a set of features is to your model. If removing a feature causes the model\\u2019s performance to deteriorate significantly, investigate why that feature is so important. Keep an eye out for new features added to your model. If adding a new feature significantly improves your model\\u2019s performance, either that feature is really good or that feature just contains leaked information about labels. Be very careful every time you look at the test split.If you use the test split in any way other than to report a model\\u2019s final performance, you risk leaking information from the future into your training process. Engineering Good Features Generally, adding more features leads to better model performance. If a feature doesn\\u2019t help a model make good predictions, regularization techniques like L1 regularization should reduce that feature\\u2019s weight to 0. Feature Importance If you use a classical ML algorithm like boosted gradient trees, the easiest way to measure the importance of your features is to use built-in feature importance functions implemented by XGBoost. For more model-agnostic methods, you might want to look into SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).SHAP is great because it not only measures a feature\\u2019s importance to an entire model, but it also measures each feature\\u2019s contribution to a model\\u2019s specific prediction.

Ensembles One method that has consistently given a performance boost is to use an ensemble of multiple models instead of just an individual model to make predictions. Each model in the ensemble is called a base learner. Ensembling methods are less favored in production because ensembles are more complex to deploy and harder to maintain. When creating an ensemble, the less correlation there is among base learners, the better the ensemble will be. Therefore, it\\u2019s common to choose very different types of models for an ensemble. Bagging = bootstrap aggregating designed to improve both the training stability and accuracy of ML algorithms. reduces variance and helps to avoid overfitting. Given a dataset, instead of training one classifier on the entire dataset, you sample with replacement to create different datasets, called bootstraps, and train a classification or regression model on each of these bootstraps. Why Sampling? Sampling with replacement ensures that each bootstrap is created independently from its peers. Boosting = a family of iterative ensemble algorithms that convert weak learners to strong ones Each learner in this ensemble is trained on the same set of samples, but the samples are weighted differently among iterations. future weak learners focus more on the examples that previous weak learners misclassified. XGBoost, a variant of GBM, used to be the algorithm of choice for many winning teams in ML competitions. Stacking you train base learners from the training data and then create a meta-learner that combines the outputs of the base learners to output final predictions meta-learner can be as simple as a heuristic: you take the majority\\u2013vote (for classification tasks) or the average vote (for regression tasks) from all base learners. Experiment Tracking and Versioning It\\u2019s important to keep track of all the definitions needed to re-create an experiment and its relevant artifacts. An artifact is a file generated during an experiment\\u2014examples of artifacts can be files that show the loss curve, evaluation loss graph, etc.The process of tracking the progress and results of an experiment is called experiment tracking. The process of logging all the details of an experiment for the purpose of possibly recreating it later or comparing it with other experiments is called versioning. Experiment tracking = babysitting the learning processes It\\u2019s important to track what\\u2019s going on during training not only to detect and address these issues but also to evaluate whether your model is learning anything useful. What should/could be tracked:Loss curve, model performance metrics, corresponding sample, prediction, ground truth label, speed of model, system performance metrics, parameter, hyperparameterA simple way to track your experiments is to automatically make copies of all the code files needed for an experiment and log all outputs with their timestamps. Versioning ML systems are part code, part data, so you need to not only version your code but your data as well. Code versioning tools allow users to revert to a previous version of the codebase by keeping copies of all the old files.

There are many components in an ML system: data, labels, features, ML algorithms, code, infrastructure, etc. These different components might be owned by different teams. some of the things that might cause an ML model to fail: Theoretical constraints Poor implementation of model Poor choice of hyperparameters Data problems Poor choice of features tried-and-true debugging techniques published by experienced ML engineers and researchers Start simple and gradually add more components Overfit a single batch Set a random seed Distributed Training It\\u2019s common to train a model using data that doesn\\u2019t fit into memory. When a sample of your data is large, e.g., one machine can handle a few samples at a time, you might only be able to work with a small batch size, which leads to instability for gradient descent-based optimization. In some cases, a data sample is so large it can\\u2019t even fit into memory and you will have to use something like gradient checkpointing, a technique that leverages the memory footprint and compute trade-off to make your system do more computation with less memory. Data parallelism you split your data on multiple machines, train your model on all of them, and accumulate gradients. Model parallelism Model parallelism is when different components of your model are trained on different machinesModel parallelism can be misleading because in some cases parallelism doesn\\u2019t mean that different parts of the model in different machines are executed in parallel. Pipeline parallelism is a clever technique to make different components of a model on different machines run more in parallel. When machine 1 finishes the first part of its computation, it passes the result onto machine 2, then continues to the second part, and so on. AutoML AutoML refers to automating the process of finding ML algorithms to solve real-world problems. One mild form, and the most popular form, of AutoML in production is hyperparameter tuning. hyperparameter = parameter supplied by users whose value is used to control the learning process, e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers, number of hidden units, dropout probability, \\u03b21 and \\u03b22 in Adam optimizer, etc. With different sets of hyperparameters, the same model can give drastically different performances on the same dataset. Melis et al. showed in their 2018 paper \\u201cOn the State of the Art of Evaluation in Neural Language Models\\u201d that weaker models with well-tuned hyperparameters can outperform stronger, fancier models. The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given model within a search space Popular ML frameworks either come with built-in utilities or have third-party utilities for hyperparameter tuning\\u2014for example, scikit-learn with auto-sklearn,25 TensorFlow with Keras Tuner, and Ray with Tune. Popular methods for hyperparameter tuning include random search,26 grid search, and Bayesian optimization. When tuning hyperparameters, keep in mind that a model\\u2019s performance might be more sensitive to the change in one hyperparameter than another, and therefore sensitive hyperparameters should be more carefully tuned. It\\u2019s crucial to never use your test split to tune hyperparameters.

Model calibration To quote Nate Silver in his book The Signal and the Noise, calibration is \\u201cone of the most important tests of a forecast\\u2014 I would argue that it is the single most important one. To measure a model\\u2019s calibration, a simple method is counting: you count the number of times your model outputs the probability X and the frequency Y of that prediction coming true, and plot X against Y. The graph for a perfectly calibrated model will have X equal Y at all data points. In scikit-learn, you can plot the calibration curve of a binary classifier with the method sklearn.calibration.calibration_curve Confidence measurement Confidence measurement can be considered a way to think about the usefulness threshold for each individual prediction. While most other metrics measure the system\\u2019s performance on average, confidence measurement is a metric for each individual sample. System-level measurement is useful to get a sense of overall performance, but sample-level metrics are crucial when you care about your system\\u2019s performance on every sample.1.2.3.Slice-based evaluation Slicing means to separate your data into subsets and look at your model\\u2019s perfor- mance on each subset separately. A common mistake that I\\u2019ve seen in many compa- nies is that they are focused too much on coarse-grained metrics like overall F1 or accuracy on the entire data and not enough on sliced-based metrics. The focus on overall performance is harmful not only because of the potential public backlash, but also because it blinds the company to huge potential model improvements. A fascinating and seemingly counterintuitive reason why slice-based evaluation is crucial is Simpson\\u2019s paradox, a phenomenon in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. This means that model B can perform better than model A on all data together, but model A performs better than model B on each subgroup separately. Even when you don\\u2019t think slices matter, understanding how your model performs in a more fine-grained way can give you confidence in your model to convince other stakeholders, like your boss or your customers, to trust your ML models.

Batch Prediction Versus Online Prediction One fundamental decision you\\u2019ll have to make that will affect both your end users and developers working on your system is how it generates and serves its predictions to end users: online or batch. Batch prediction, which uses only batch features. Online prediction that uses only batch features (e.g., precomputed embeddings). Online prediction that uses both batch features and streaming features. This is also known as streaming prediction. Online prediction is when predictions are generated and returned as soon as requests for these predictions arrive. = on-demand prediction // synchronous prediction Batch prediction is when predictions are generated periodically or whenever triggered. The predictions are stored somewhere, such as in SQL tables or an in-memory database, and retrieved as needed. = asynchronous prediction Features computed from historical data, such as data in databases and data warehouses, are batch features. Features computed from streaming data\\u2014data in real-time transports\\u2014are\\u25cf\\u25cfstreaming features. In batch prediction, only batch features are used. In online prediction, however, it\\u2019s possible to use both batch features and streaming features. Online prediction and batch prediction don\\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive. One hybrid solution is that you precompute predictions for popular queries, then generate predictions online for less popular queries. From Batch Prediction to Online Prediction The more natural way to serve predictions is probably online. You give your model an input and it generates a prediction as soon as it receives that input. You export your model, upload the exported model to Amazon SageMaker or Google App Engine, and get back an exposed endpoint. Now, if you send a request that contains an input to that endpoint, it will send back a prediction generated on that input.A problem with online prediction is that your model might take too long to generate predictions. Instead of generating predictions as soon as they arrive, what if you compute predictions in advance and store them in your database, and fetch them when requests arrive? This is exactly what batch prediction does. Batch prediction can also be seen as a trick to reduce the inference latency of more complex models\\u2014the time it takes to retrieve a prediction is usually less than the time it takes to generate it. Batch prediction is good for when you want to generate a lot of predictions and don\\u2019t need the results immediately.
