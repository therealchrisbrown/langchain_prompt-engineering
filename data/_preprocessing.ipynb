      "Scalability: An ML system might grow in ML model count. Autoscaling\n",

      "Data Models\n",

      "Structured Versus Unstructured Data\n",
      "Structured data follows a predefined data model, also known as a data schema.\n",
      "The disadvantage of structured data is that you have to commit your data to a\n",
      "predefined schema. If your schema changes, you’ll have to retrospectively\n",
      "update all your data, often causing mysterious bugs in the process.\n",
      "Unstructured data doesn’t adhere to a predefined data schema. It’s usually text\n",
      "but can also be numbers, dates, images, audio, etc.\n",
      "Unstructured data also allows for more flexible storage options.\n",
      "A repository for storing structured data is called a data warehouse.\n",

      "In the extracting phase, you need to validate your data and reject the data that\n",
      "doesn’t meet your requirements.\n",
      "Transform is, where most of the data processing is done. You might want to join\n",
      "data from multiple sources and clean it. You might want to standardize the\n",
      "value ranges.\n",
      "Load is deciding how and how often to load your transformed data into the\n",
      "target destination, which can be a file, a database, or a data warehouse.\n",
      "Finding it difficult to keep data structured, some companies had this idea: “Why\n",

      "This process of loading data into storage first and then processing it later is\n",
      "sometimes called ELT (extract, load, transform).\n",

      "BUT 2: As companies switch to running applications on the cloud and\n",

What business performance metrics is the new ML system supposed to influence, e.g., the amount of ads revenue, the number of monthly active users? The longer you’ve adopted ML, the more efficient your pipeline will run, the faster your development cycle will be, the less engineering time you’ll need, and the lower your cloud bills will be, which all lead to higher returns. RequirementsReliability: With traditional software systems, you often get a warning, such as a system crash or runtime error or 404. However, ML systems can fail silently. Scalability: An ML system might grow in ML model count. Autoscaling is an indispensable feature in many cloud services: automatically scaling up and down the number of machines depending on usage. Maintainability: Code should be documented. Code, data, and artifacts should be versioned. Models should be sufficiently reproducible so that even when the original authors are not around, other contributors can have sufficient contexts to build on their work. Adaptability: ML systems need to be able to evolve quickly. Iterative Process: Once a system is put into production, it’ll need to be continually monitored and updated. The process looks more like a cycle with a lot of back and forth between different steps. An ML problem is defined by inputs, outputs, and the objective function that guides the learning process. Classification models classify inputs into different categories. Regression models output a continuous value. A regression model can easily be framed as a classification model and vice versa.', metadata={'source': './__original-data/📚BOOK NOTE : Huyen_2022_Designing Machine Learning Systems: an iterative\\xa0….pdf', 'page': 0})"
